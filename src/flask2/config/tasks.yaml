planning_interpreter_task:
  description: >
    The user provides a description of their routine in the `user_planning_text` field.
    Your job is to extract all identifiable events, and for each one:

    - Extract `label`: only the name of the activity (e.g., "acordar", "psicólogo", "jiu-jitsu").
      Do NOT include time, date, or weekday phrases inside the label.
    - Extract `frequency`: if the user mentions days of the week or "todos os dias", convert to weekday array.
      If the user mentions a specific date (e.g., "dia 13 de julho"), use it in ["dd/mm/yyyy"] format.
    - Extract `time`: if a time is provided, use it. Else, default to "12:00".
    - Extract `start_date`: if mentioned explicitly (e.g., "a partir de", "starting from"), use it.
      Otherwise, use today’s date (current system date).

  expected_output: >
    Given this input:

    ```json
    { "user_planning_text": "{user_planning_text}" }
    ```

    Return a JSON array like:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "label": "acordar",
        "frequency": ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"],
        "start_date": "09/07/2025",
        "time": "08:00"
      },
      {
        "label": "psicólogo",
        "frequency": ["friday"],
        "start_date": "09/07/2025",,
        "time": "15:00"
      }
    ]
    ```

    Do NOT repeat date/time/day info inside the label field.
